# Unilever-Canteen-Ordering-Delivery-System--A-Full-Business-Analysis-Lifecycle
I worked with a team to analyse and redesign Unilever’s canteen experience by identifying productivity loss, food waste, and operational inefficiencies, then proposing a digital online meal ordering and delivery system supported by detailed business analysis techniques.

# Project Overview
Unilever’s UK offices have about 1,500 employees across 12 floors, but only two canteens with limited seating. During peak lunch hours, staff lose an average of 30 to 35 minutes waiting in long queues for food and seating, leading to reduced productivity and dissatisfaction. This proposed online canteen ordering and delivery system allows employees to pre-order meals before 11 a.m., have them delivered to their workstations, and streamline kitchen operations, inventory planning, and payroll deductions. This solution aims to reduce food waste, improve employee satisfaction, and modernize Unilever’s internal operations.

# Business Problems
The business problems faced by Unilever’s canteen were centred on lost productivity, food shortages, and operational inefficiencies. Employees regularly spent 30 to 35 minutes queuing for lunch, which meant most of their one-hour break was wasted on waiting rather than eating, and this significantly reduced overall productivity across the organisation. At the same time, the canteen struggled with inconsistent food availability because there was no system to forecast demand, causing popular meals to run out while unpopular meals were overproduced and discarded, leading to both dissatisfaction and unnecessary food waste. The manual, non-digital setup also created delays, errors, and a lack of visibility into menus, orders, or performance, leaving the canteen unable to make data-driven decisions or streamline operations. 

# My Role as a Business Analyst
I worked with a team and my responsiblities included the following and in no particular order:

- **Understanding the Current State**

- **Stakeholder Identification and Analysis**

- **Writing the Business Case**

- **RACI Matrix Creation**

- **Requirement Gathering and Documentation**

- **Process Mapping**

- **User Story Creation with acceptance criteria following Agile/INVEST principles**

- **Vendor Evaluation**

# Important Discoveries

- **Queue time being the biggest driver of lost productivity.**

- **Food waste was directly linked to a lack of pre-Order visibility.**

- **Employees need convenience over traditional canteen use.**

- **Payroll integration as a non-negotiable requirement as accurate salary deductions had to be fully automated.**

- **Digital transformation opportunities: analytics, real-time menu updates, order visibility, and system reporting which aligns with Unilever’s broader modernization strategy.**

# Tools Used

- **Word/PDF for documentation, analysis, and reporting.**
  
- **Draw.io for process maps.**

- **JIRA for sprint creation, backlog management, and Agile documentation.**

# Project Deliverables

- **Stakeholder List**

This deliverable identifies everyone affected by the new canteen system, such as employees, chefs, the canteen manager, payroll, HR, IT, and senior management.

- **Stakeholder Power–Interest Matrix**

This matrix organizes stakeholders based on how much power they hold and how interested they are in the project, making it easier to decide who needs close management, who should be kept informed, and who should be kept satisfied throughout the system’s development.

- **Full Business Case Report**

The business case presents the current problems, evaluates different solution options, includes cost estimates, and proves the return on investment. It gives senior management clear reasons to approve the new online ordering system by showing how it improves productivity, reduces waste, and aligns with Unilever's digital transformation goals.

- **RACI Matrix**

This clarifies project roles by specifying who is Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed for each major task. This prevents confusion, improves coordination, and ensures every aspect of the implementation is clearly owned by the right stakeholders.

- **Future State Process Flow and Swimlane Diagram**

This deliverable visually maps how the entire ordering, preparation, delivery, and payroll deduction process will work once the new system is implemented. It helps all stakeholders understand how their responsibilities fit together and how the new workflow eliminates current inefficiencies.

- **Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**

These requirements define what the system must do, such as menu viewing, order creation, delivery tracking, and payroll deduction, as well as how the system should perform in terms of speed, security, reliability, and usability.

- **User Stories and Acceptance Criteria**

This translates the requirements into simple, goal-focused statements from the perspective of employees, canteen staff, and managers. Acceptance criteria define what must be true for each story to be considered complete, guiding the development team and supporting testing.

- **Jira Backlog, Board, and Sprints**

These were broken into sprints, prioritized, and tracked in Jira. They demonstrate Agile planning, sprint structuring, and how user stories were organized for development and testing.

# Conclusion

The canteen ordering system project addresses major operational inefficiencies within Unilever’s existing lunch process, including long queues, food shortages, and significant productivity loss. By introducing a digital pre-ordering and delivery solution, the business stands to reduce waiting time, eliminate food waste, improve employee satisfaction, and streamline payroll deductions. The system is aligned with Unilever’s digital transformation goals and has strong ROI potential, paying for itself within the first month of go-live. This structured work ensures the BA's role in showing clarity of requirements, alignment across stakeholders, and a clear roadmap for implementation.
